## Install:
- Before downloading, make sure you're on XBMC 3.6-DEV-r33046 or later, as this most likely requires up to date TLS/SSL libraries!
- Download latest release .zip
- Extract the .zip file and edit "login.txt" to contain your full username (ie; username.bsky.social or username.custom.domain) and app password (do not use your actual password!)
- Edit "default.py" and modify "TIMEZONE_OFFSET = -5" to your local timezone relative to UTC (-5 is EST) for accurate timestamps
- Copy the xChat folder to Q:/scripts/plugins/programs
- (Optional) if using a non-Bluesky AT protocol site, you'll have to modify the BASE_URL in default.py to point at that site! Support outside of Bluesky is entirely unsupported, but testing & contributing is encouraged!
- Run the add-on and enjoy!

## Working
- Sending / receiving messages
- Receiving notifications (via notifier.py)

## Not Working
- TBA

## TODO:
- Implement game invites (merge with Cortana Server Browser games.txt, and use the AT protocol DM function to send a message that says "user.bsky.social would like to play Halo 2 with you", and if the script detects that sentence structure, will allow the end user to launch the game directly)
